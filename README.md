# Redesigned Prusa i3 (Full) Bear Upgrade Parts

This repository contains (at some point in time) all the parts that I customize for the Full Bear Upgrade by Gr√©goire Saunier (https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade/ and https://github.com/gregsaun/bear_extruder_and_x_axis).


What is currently available:

## X-Axis ##
X-End mount which features removable shafts. Just use your t-nuts and 5mm screws of which you should have plenty left from the Bear Upgrade, and you can lock your smooth rods in place. If you have to maintain your extruder or want to change something else on the x-axis, just slide the smooth rods out. No disassembly of the entire z-axis needed anymore. Furthermore, the belt tensioner inlay can be used with a regular 3mm cylindric hat screw and a quadratic nut (of which you should also have spare parts from the MK2.5 kit). This differs from the original Full Bear tensioner, where you have to get a Delrin rod or some other bolt/pin. The inlay can be moved back an forth by about 3mm to tension the belt.


## Y-Axis ##
Because I dearly hate the original lm8uu bearings because of the noise level I use some from igus (RJ4JP-01-08). However, these bearings only perform well if they are aligned correctly and are not squeezed unevenly.
To achieve this state I made some clips for the original MK2 and MK2S version of the Prusa i3 printer. Now, with the Full Bear Upgrade, there is plenty of space underneath the y-axis, and the clips can be bigger and more elaborate.
I redesigned the clips from the ground up, and the result is the new igus bracket. This bracket has some more advantages: First off, after the first assembly, you don't need to disassemble the heat bed anymore if you want to replace your bearings. The bracket consists of two parts; the top parts can stay attached to the heat bed sled while the bottom portion can be unmounted from the bottom.
Please just make sure you are using long enough but not too long 3mm screws. I am using six 18mm long screws and six square nuts for one bracket.


Please see the pictures I put into the repository and provide me some feedback.
